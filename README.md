## Development

### Installing Dependencies

From within the root directory:

```sh
npm install -g webpack
npm install
```
This will install all necessary dependencies.

### Getting Started

The first and foremost task is to get mariadb downloaded, up and running.  After that, you should create a file named ```login.js``` and place within the database folder with the necessary mariadb login information (e.g. user, password, host, and default database) in an object format.

Next step is to run the seeding script ```npm run seed```. This will seed the database with mock data that can be viewed by going specific endpoints (explained later.)

The next step is to use two terminals to start the webpack build watching and the server
```
npm run build:dev
npm run start:dev
```
Following that, you can open up a browser and go to http://localhost:3002/:id where :id represents an id referencing a mock listing from our database.  You may use the numbers 1-100 for the id value.

### Testing

Finally, to test our program we can run the following tests after code changes.  
```npm run test```
